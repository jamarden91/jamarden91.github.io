<h2> The following is a step by step guide on how to corectly set up a brand new aquarium</h2>
	<p> So you have decided to get yourself an aquarium, befor you go out and buy it there are a few thing you might want to consider.
	First and formost what is your budget, setting up a brand new fish tank isnt cheep by any means so you probably want to go price
	some it before you go and buy 50 gallon tank. Secondly is where are you going to put it and what are you going to put it on tank starnds can cost
	just as much if not more than the tank its self. Finaly how much time do you want to put into it the bigger the tank the more offten
	you will have to clean it and the longer it will take you to clean it.</p>
			<h2>Step 1</h2>
			<p> <b>Buying the tank and equipment</b> <br>
			There are a lot more thing you need than you would think to maintianing a clean and healthy fish tank. To set you off on the right track hear are
			a few things you will need to get started.</p>
				<li>
					<ul>Fish tank </ul>
					<ul>Substraight (gravle, sand, dirt, .ect)</ul>
					<ul>Gravle cacume</ul>
					<ul> Filter (make shure it is the corect size)</ul>
					<ul> Declore</ul>
					<ul>Decorations (optional but perfered)</ul>
					<ul>Heater</ul>
				</li>
<h2>Step 2</h2>
			<p> Thoughly wash substraight and decorations <b>DO NOT</b> use soap or detergents because they are highly toxic to the fish.
			Than add your substraight, decoratios and equipment to the tank; Idealy you should arange decore to hide equipment like bubblers, heaters, and the fillter.</p>
			
<h2>Step 3</h2>
			<p>Fiil the tankt pouring water on to a saucer sitting on the gravle to not desturbe the substraight till the water is level with the trim of the tank.
			Now its time to turn on you filter, heater and any other equipment you might have. Heater should be set to approximitly 75 degrees farinhight and fill the filter with water
			before turning it on so not to burn out the pump. It is ideal to let the tank set for tow or three days before adding fish so that it may start its cycle and grow the healthy
			bactira need for your fish to survive.</p>
<h3>Step4</h3>
			<p>Finaly you get to add fish, it is ideal to do research on what kind of fish you want to get if they will make good tank mates. Preferibly you would
			want to get all peacefull and some simagresiv fish, or all aggresive fish. If you are not shure hears some <a href="
			pg.1.html">INFO</a> to help you decide. When adding your fish try not to add pet store water
			due to the high bactira levels in the water. It is also a good idea to not add all of you fish at once to not over load you eco system.</p>
