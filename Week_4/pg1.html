         <h1>Choosing Good Tank Mates</h1> </head>

<body>
	<p>When you fist start stalking your tank with fish it is always a good idea to know what tipe of tank you trying to create. Some fish such as mollis and guppies are great for comunity tanks due to there
	peacfull natrue they get along with all fish that dont eat them. Others such as bettas and gromies have surtan restrictions to keeping them and need those restraints to be met. In the end what really needs
	to happen is for you to research the fish before adding it to the tank.</p>

	<h2>Nonagresive</h2>
			<p> Nonagresive fish are compatable with allmost all other fish this is why they are found in the majority of aquariums. It is still a good idea to research the fishes water chemistry. For
			exsample most tropicle fish and gold fish would not fair well in the same tank, due to the fact that gold fish enjoy colder water while tropical fish needs warmer water. With this in mind
			hear is a list of a few of Nonagresive fish that would do well in a tropical tank.</p>
			
			<li>
				<ul>Guppies</ul>
				<ul>molies</ul>
				<ul>platies</ul>
				<ul>Plecos</ul>
				<ul>tetras</ul>
				<ul>rainbow fish</ul>
				<ul>glass catfish</ul>
			</li>
			
			
		<h2>smiagresive</h2>
			<P> Smiagressive fish are not really as scary as they sound. For me the rule of thumb has been only one of the species per tank. I say this bacause most smiagressive fish are really just
			taritorial so one per tank or 20 gallons is alwyas a good idea because it gives them plenty of roomd. The exception to this rule <a>Beeta fish</a>there should only ever be one fish any size tank
			due to there violent tendancies. To give you an idea of what fish to loook out for hear is a list of some of them that i have delt with.</P>
			
				<li>
					<ul> Fresh water sharks</ul>
					<ul><a herf="info/page2.html"> Betta fish </a></ul>
					<ul>Gromies</ul>
					<ul>angle fish</ul>
					<ul>kilifish</ul>
				</li>
				
		<h2>Aggresive</h2>
			<p>Aggresive fish are a verry small group of fish but they are also some of the most beautiful. The down side is that you can normaly only keep that one specis of fish or similar species.
			The reason for this is because they will eat literary any thing that will fit in there mouths and will try to eat many things that cant. So to give you a good ball park hears a list of
			you ususal suspects.</p>
				<li>
					<ul>Chiclids</ul>
					<ul>Oscors</ul>
					<ul> Redparit fish</ul>
				</li>
